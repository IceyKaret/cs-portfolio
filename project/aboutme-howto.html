        <h1 align="middle" class="title">How To - About Me!</h1>
        <p> How did I make the about me page? Let me show you! or not... if you don't want to know.</p>
        <p class="text"> There is a whole lot of code that makes up the about me page so lets break out down we'll go from the top to the bottom. Let's start with the code that makes up the navbar, those wierd bubble things at the top that you can click on.</p>
        <div>
            <p> Lets take a look at this first chunk of code -</p>
            <img src="../img/h1.png">
            <p class="text">The first tag is the head tag which simply tells the browser that the head section of the code is over, next we have the body tag which tells the browser that this part of the code is content for the webpage and should be displayed. The reason for everything to be inside this
            tag is that this way the browser doesn't get confused and you can easily tell where to put your code. the nest line of code starts with the ul tag, the ul tag stands for unordered list and inside we have two attributes, the class - navbar and the alignment - center. The ul tag just tells the browser that it should format the content within the tag as an unordered or unnumbered list. The first attribute is very important, it specifies what CSS code is connected to the unordered list. The align attribute is not really relevant in this code because as you can tell the navbar is not aligned in the center, this is because the attribute is overrided by the CSS. This is all very confusing and it's easy to get lost so let's take out some of the context to make it easier.</p>
            <img src="../img/h2.png"
            <br><p class="text"> Here we have three tags that are all the same they are a tags which are used to create links. The first attribute within the a tag is the href attribute which stands for hypertext reference, this is basically the source of the link. In the case of the first a tag the href links to index.html meaning that if the viewer clicks that link it will direct the viewer to the Index, The reason I wrote the text like this is so that the viewer can easily move from one page to the next. The next tag is the li tag which stands for list item, in the case of making a navbar we started by making a unordered list, this next part is simply telling the browser what to display as the list item. The reason we want this to be here is because without it the browser wouldn't display any text and the viewer wouldn't know where that link went. At the end we have the same tags, the a and li tags but this time with slashes. 
            In HTML you must always have two tags one with a slash on the end and one without at the start. So a question you might have is why is the list item tag inside of the a tag? The reason I formatted it this way is so that the a tag will display the list items text as part of the button and will also be a part of the link so that the user can click on it.</p>
            <h5>On to the next section of text!</h5>
            <img src="../img/h3.png">
            <p class="text">The first tag is the header tag which tells the browser theat the text inside of the tag should be formatted in a certain way. The browser will make the text inside bigger and seem more important. There are six types of headers, h1-6 the hiogher the number the more important. The reason I used h1 for this part of my webpage is because it is the title and that means I want the viewer to notice it, it is the most important part of the webpage.
            We have already seen the two attributes inside so I wont go over them. Then we see that the text "About Me and What I've Learned so Far!" is wrapped inside of the h1 tag, this is the content and is what the browser will format. The second tag is anohter header so we can skip over that. The next tag is a very simple and very common tag, the p tag. The p tag is the paragraph tag and the browser will simply display anything inside the p tag on to the webpage.
            Then on the next line we have a ending p tag which is on the next line down, this is actually incorrect and should be on the same line as the other p tag and the text. The reason this is here is because as you may notice on the about me page it does not affect the format. Why is this? The browser simply ignores the white space in a page so the reason the backslash p tag is incorrect is because it makes the page hard to read and is incorrectly formatted. This does not actually affect how the browser reads the text. 
            Inside the paragraph is another tag though, this is a break tag or a br tag. The br tag is used to make text break up and go to the next line.The next tag we have is an img tag or an image tag this is used as you may guess for inserting images onto the webpage. Inside the image tag is the src attribute, this tells the browser where this image comes from in this case it comes fro the super long url that comnes off the edge of the screenshot.
            Lastly we have another p ntag and a closing div tag. Whew that was a long block of text.</p>
            <h5>Onwards! Oh, wait your bored? Have a gif!</h5>
            <img src="http://media2.giphy.com/media/12Nxp9loRy1yPC/giphy.gif">
            <h5>Thats not the right one... thats you. BE HAPPY!</h5>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iPTTjEt19igne/giphy.gif">
            <h5>Onwards!</h5>
            <img src="../img/h4.png">
            <p class="text"> The first line of this code is the div tag. The div tag allows you to apply a style or attribute to multiple things at once. The div tag is also divides parts of the code to make it easier to read. Net we have a bunch of break tags and then an image. The reason I have so many break tags is just to add spacing and make the website look nice. After that we have a paragraph and then a header. The last section we have here is all one large unordered list. The li or list item tags are within the ul tags. This creates a list with no numbers and only bullet points. This list is aligned left because if you look at the about me page you will see that most of the content is. </p>
            <img src="../img/h5.png">
            <p>This may look imposing at first but its really not so bad. This big block of code is made up of only 3 tags and 2 entities. The 3 tags are the li tag which we already learned, the ul tag which we also already learned. The only tag we haven't learned is the strong tag. The strong tag is used to bold text. The strong tag is used within a content tag and it wraps content inside telling the broiwser to style the text wrapped inside. The other tag that is very similiar to this is the em tag this is used with the same effect but instead it italicizes the content of the tag. The two entities are... I don't know how to type them normally. These entities are highlighted in light blue and are used to create angle brackets in the normal content of the website.</p>
            <h5>Onwards one last time!</h5>
            <img src="../img/h6.png">
            <p class="text">Ahhhhh! confusing! Let's take a closer look first, if we look closely this is actually the almost the same thing except repeated 4 times in a row and contained inside div tags.</p>
            <img src="../img/h7.png">
            <p class="text"> The whole chunk of text is contained inside the div tags, the first line starts with the break tag then a strong tag. These are both for style and formatting, basically to make the webpage look nice. Then its a paragraph tag with some text and finally lots of images. See, not so confusing. Good job! Now you know the basics of making a website!</p>
