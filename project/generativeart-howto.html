        <h2 align="middle">Intro:</h2>
        <p>This page is all about how I made my generative art! 
        For our generative art we used the programming language 
        javascript along with additional code known as javascript
        processing. During this expedition block I have learned a
        lot about javascript and processing. Throughout this page
        I will try my best to explain what I learned including 
        some specifics of my code and some challenges I faced 
        creating my program. Firstly, before we jump into the 
        explaining, I need to tell you what my generative art is!
        My generative art is a <u>very</u> simple drawing program 
        which allows you to draw using a few shapes and colors. 
        In addition to this you can also make shaoes larger or smaller. 
        You can easily view my generative art by clicking on the 
        appropriate link on the nav bar.
        <h2> Shapes!</h2>
        <p>Shapes are integral parts of my program, and
        each have specific code used to create them. First I'll 
        explain how to make a rectangle, the rect() function creates 
        a rectangle based on 4 parameters x, y, with, height. For
        instance: rect( 40, 70, 30, 30) would create a rectangle with 
        a top right corner located at x 1 and y 70 and would have a 
        height and width of 30. Pretty simple right? An ellipse() 
        function might look something like this: 
        ellipse(40, 70, 30, 30);. The difference between an ellipse 
        and a rectangle even if they appear to have the same values 
        is that the x and y positions for the ellipse show where the
        ellipse's <u>center</u> is as opposed to the right corner of 
        the rectangle.<img src="../img/p1.png"> <br>These two shapes have
        the same parameter values and yet 
        they are in different places because of how the parameters 
        effect the location of the shape. This was a problem I 
        encountered during the creation of my generative art because 
        if effected where the shapes got drawn in relation to the
        mouses location. To overcome this I added to the x and y 
        values when I switched from drawing with a circle to a 
        rectangle or a rectangle to a circle. Even now it is 
        slightly glitchy because of this problem. <br>In my generative 
        art I used both rect and ellipse as well as line (line has
        4 parameters the x any of the start and end point). I used
        rect and ellipse to create buttons for my sidebar and also
        as a part of my drawing program because you can draw with
        the shapes. Using the size I was able to add the ability to
        change the size of the shapes you were drawing with.</p> 
        <h2>Colors!</h2>
        <p>Colors are 
        simple, you can use the fill() function to specify the color
        of objects below the function. The fill() function uses the
        parameters r,g,b to determine the color of the objects. You
        can even use multiple fill() functions to create varying 
        colors between objects. Take this code for example:<br>
        fill(255, 0, 0)<br> 
        rect(40, 70, 30, 30);<br>fill(255, 255, 255)
        <br>ellipse(40, 70, 30, 30) <br> Creates: 
        <br><img src="../img/p2.png"><br>This variation of colors can be created because of the
        overlapping fill() functions, the first fill function makes 
        both shapes red and the second fill() function makes only the 
        second shape white. The reason for this is the order of said fill()
        functions inside of the code. <br>In my generative art I used the fill()
        command to color my shapes various colors. I used the variables 
        rbgRed/Green/Blue (scroll down to learn about variables) to change
        the color as specified by fill(). In my program color is important 
        because it is a drawing program (pretty self explanatory). One of 
        the few things you can do with the program is change the color with
        which you are drawing from red, white, green, and blue.</p>
        <h2>Functions!</h2>
        <p> Functions contain codeblocks and when a function is called the computer runs the codeblock. 
        For instance you could put a click() function inside a 
        mouseClicked function so that when the mouseClicked() function
        is called (the mouse is clicked) the click() function is called.
        Inside the click() there could be any codeblock, perhaps it
        creates a circle or makes a pop-up. The code of a function would 
        look something like this: function click() { rect( 40, 70, 30, 30) }; <br> 
        This code tells the computer that when the click() function is
        called it should create a rectangle based on the stated parameters.
        If you wanted to call the click() function you would simply use 
        click() in place of the rect() function. <br>Functions can be
        extremely useful in making your code more efficient to write.
        <br><img width="50%" height="50%" src="../img/p4.png"> <br> The
        image above is how a function is organized, the function 
        4 parts, the function decleration tells the computer that this
        code is a function. The next part, the function name tells the 
        computer when to call the function. The arguement tells the
        computer when the function can run (if left blank than it will 
        always run). The last part, the statement, is the codeblock that
        the computer will run. In my generative art I used functions to expedite
        the process of pushing vaues to my array. I created a function that when 
        called upon would push the mouse's current x, y, the shape's size and a 
        bunch of other values(scroll down to learn more about arrays). The program
        also uses the draw function which is a part of processing (I didn't 
        write the draw function) and the mouseClicked/Dragged functions which
        come as a part of Javascript Processing. I used the mouseClicked/Dragged
        functions to create shapes based on where the user clicks or drags 
        their mouse.</p>
        <h2>Loops!</h2>
        <p>Loops tell the computer to run a specific codeblock as long as
        a condition is met. There are two types of loops, for loops and if
        loops. for loops run as long as something is true, if loops run if
        something is true. For loops and if loops use similiar structures,
        for loops are structured with for(arguement){statement}  whereas if
        loops simply have if inplace of for. for Loops are extremely useful 
        if you need to constantly keep check if something is true. if loops 
        are useful if you need to make something happen when a condition is 
        met or is you need to set a condition for something to happen. In my
        generative art I used both if and for loops. <br>In my generative art I
        am running the background() function which constantly creates more 
        backgrounds, this allows me to make it so that I have a rectangle 
        following my mouse and not leave rectangle behind, howver, this 
        creates problems if you want to have objects stay somewhere without
        getting covered. To solvethis problem I used for loops to create 
        an infinite loop of creating the same shapes. This made it so that
        everytime the background() functionwas run the computer simply 
        recreated shapes back on top. This was useful for making the "sidebar"
        of my generativeart.<br> The second way I used a for loop was when I 
        created created rectangles based on values in my array (This is 
        explained in the array section of this how to page). I used if loops
        to create a sort of barrier around my sidebar so that you could not 
        draw on the sidebar. The way I did this was by creating an if loop 
        inside of the mouseClicked function stating that if mouseX (the
        mouse's X position) was greater than the sidebar + a bit of a 
        buffer accounting for the size of the shape then you could draw.
        If the if loop was not met the function would be null.</p>
        <h2>Variables!</h2>
        <p>Variables can be used in place of numbers or even words and
        allow you to change the value of multiple items at once. They can
        also allow you to write code more efficiently. Variables are
        genenerally declared near the beginning of the code using the 
        format var title = statement; For example in my code I have 
        several variables one of which is the "size" variable I use 
        this variable to change the size of my shapes. The code looks
        like this: var size = 20; This makes any shape with the 
        variable "size" instead of its width and height have a
        width and height of 20 as defined by the variable. The 
        shape's code would look like this: rect(40, 70, size, size); 
        with (as you can see) the "size" variable being used in 
        replacement of the width and height. In my generativeart I used 
        quite a few variables: <img width="90%" height="90%" src="../img/p5.png">
        <br> var myArr = []; creates the array  var rgbRed/Green/Blue create the 
        variables I used to specify color. I used var shape to reuse 
        the same code whether I was using squares or crircles or so 
        that the user can change what shape they are drawing with 
        using the program. shapePos, size, and barrier allow me to 
        change multiple areas of my program all at once. Variables 
        were exceedingly helpful in their ability to make things 
        uniform. </p>
        <h2>Arrays!</h2>
        <p>Arrays... arrays are confusing. Lets start simple, arrays
        are lists that you can store information in. How is this useful? 
        Arrays can be used by the computers to "remember" things such
        as where a user clicked. In my generative art I used this to 
        create shapes that stay where the user clicks or drags. <br><br><img src="../img/p3.gif">
        Using my generative art you can change the color and size of the
        objects yous are drawing. In order for each object to be 
        individual to some degreee the array must store variables 
        for each value such as size and x and y position. The code
        I used for this is: myArr.push( {x: mouseX - shapePos, y: mouseY
        - shapePos, r: rgbRed, g: rgbGreen, b: rgbBlue, s: size, sh: shape});
        As you can see this codeblock uses the myArr.push function to 
        push the specified values back to the array. This is located inside 
        a function that is called when the mouse is clicked or dragged. 
        With these values the shapes created when you click or drag retain
        their attributes such as size and color. In order to set up an array
        you simply create a variable with brackets instead of a statement. 
        It will look something like this: var myArr = []; As more values 
        are pushed into the array they will be stored here. In turn 
        the array can than be called upon for its stored values. In my
        code I use this code: <br><br>for(var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++)
        { fill(myArr[i].r, myArr[i].g, myArr[i].b); myArr[i].sh(myArr[i].x,
        myArr[i].y, myArr[i].s, myArr[i].s );<br><br> to call upon the values I stored
        with myArr.push. This for loop is infinite as long as i is less than
        the number of values in the array so the loop will constantly 
        create rectangles based off of the values stored inside the array. In 
        addition to this the loop will contantly fill the said rectangles with 
        colors based off of the arrays stored color values. <br>Lets take apart 
        this section of code here: myArr[i].y is used instead of the typical
        y value that you might find inside of a typical rect function. The 
        function uses the "i"th y value that the array has stored. The .y tells
        the computer which variable to use and and the i tells the computer
        which entry of y to use (in this case it uses each y value in turn).
        Arrays were super helpful in creating my generative art but also were
        a challenge to learn. As you can tell they are extremely confusing but
        can be indispensible once you learn to use them.

        <h2>What I learned during this project</h2>
        <p>Just to start, this was a fun and interesting project (most of the time).
        I enjoyed the problem solving and steeper learning curve of Javascript over 
        HTML and CSS. Also the nature of the projects in general helped the class to
        be more interesting overall. What I learned? The obvious answer is that I 
        learned a lot about programming in Javascript Processing and programming 
        in general. However, I also feel like I have improved my problem solving 
        skills and grown to better understand programming as an idea and the general
        concpets behind it. One interesting thing that I discovered during this 
        project was that there are very few similarities between HTML/CSS and 
        Javascript. In reflection I feel like I worked better this block of 
        expeditions than last block and as a result both learned more and made
        a better end result. If I had infinite time to work on this project what
        would I improve? I'm not totally sure, I would continue to learn more
        about Javascript Processing and improve my project as I learn more techniques
        and things you can use Javascript processing for. </p>
